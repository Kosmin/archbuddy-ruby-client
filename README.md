# archbuddy-ruby-client

The **Ruby client** for the [architecture-auditor](https://github.com/Kosmin/architecture-auditor)
engine. It captures a language-agnostic execution/call **graph** from a Ruby codebase, hands the
engine an *opaque* graph to analyze, and reconnects the engine's findings back to real code
locally — producing a ranked **architecture clutter report**.

## What archbuddy is

`archbuddy` is **one half of a two-repo system**:

- **archbuddy-ruby-client (this repo)** owns *capture* and *reconnect*.
- **[architecture-auditor](https://github.com/Kosmin/architecture-auditor) (the engine)** owns the
  shared **Contract** (ids/serializer/validator/schemas) and the *analysis* (graph → findings).

It owns two CLI concerns:

- **Collector** (`collect`): a static-AST adapter (via `prism`) that walks a Ruby codebase into
  method-level nodes + directed call/db/endpoint/external edges, then **anonymizes** them — emitting:
  - `graph.yml` — shareable, **opaque** node-ids, zero app semantics (safe to hand to the engine).
  - `id-map.yml` — **SECRET**, local-only, gitignored: maps each opaque id → `file:line:symbol`.
- **Reconnect + Report** (`report`): joins the engine's `findings.yml` back against the secret
  `id-map.yml` to produce a **ranked clutter report** scored against real code symbols.

The pluggable `Adapter` interface means a future React/Node.js client is a new adapter, not a rewrite.

## Data flow

```
your repo ──> archbuddy collect ──> graph.yml + id-map.yml(SECRET)
graph.yml ──> architecture-auditor analyze ──> findings.yml
findings.yml + id-map.yml ──> archbuddy report ──> ranked clutter report
```

`id-map.yml` **never leaves this machine** and is the only thing that can de-anonymize the graph.

## Requirements

- Ruby **>= 3.2** (see `.ruby-version`). Ruby 3.4.2 is auto-selected by rbenv from `.ruby-version`
  when you're in the repo; if your shell doesn't auto-switch, prefix commands with
  `RBENV_VERSION=ruby-3.4.2`.
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
- The **`architecture_auditor` engine gem** (the shared contract + the `analyze` CLI). See below.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kosmin/archbuddy-ruby-client.git
cd archbuddy-ruby-client
bundle install
```

### Installing the engine dependency

`archbuddy` depends on the `architecture_auditor` gem for the shared Contract. The `Gemfile` is wired
so a **fresh clone installs cleanly** *and* local dev keeps its ergonomics:

- **Default (fresh clone / distribution):** the engine resolves from its **git source**
  (`https://github.com/Kosmin/architecture-auditor.git`, branch `main`). No sibling checkout needed.
- **Local dev — two ways to point at a sibling checkout (`../architecture-auditor`):**

  1. **Env override (zero config), one-off:**
     ```bash
     ARCHITECTURE_AUDITOR_PATH=../architecture-auditor bundle install
     ```
     An unset/blank value falls through to the git source.

  2. **Bundler local override (persistent, no env needed)** — preferred for a permanent sibling:
     ```bash
     bundle config set --local local.architecture_auditor ../architecture-auditor
     bundle install
     ```
     Bundler resolves the git gem from that local path automatically (it must be on the same branch).

  Either mode lets a sibling checkout "just work" without editing the `Gemfile`.

## Quickstart — the full pipeline

The three stages share a single **`.archbuddy/`** workspace dir (relative to your CWD), so the whole
flow runs **flag-free**. (The middle stage runs the **engine**, not this repo.)

```bash
archbuddy collect .              # → .archbuddy/graph.yml + .archbuddy/id-map.yml (SECRET)
architecture-auditor analyze     # → .archbuddy/findings.yml   (the OTHER repo)
archbuddy report                 # → ranked clutter report (de-anonymized, local-only)
```

> Ruby 3.4.2 is auto-selected by rbenv from `.ruby-version` when you're in the repo; if your shell
> doesn't auto-switch, prefix commands with `RBENV_VERSION=ruby-3.4.2`.

### 1. Collect — capture + anonymize your codebase

```bash
archbuddy collect .
# → .archbuddy/graph.yml      (opaque, shareable)
# → .archbuddy/id-map.yml     (SECRET — local-only, never share/commit)
```

`--out-dir` is **optional** and defaults to `.archbuddy/`. **The secret stays safe automatically:**
when you use the default dir inside a git repo, `archbuddy` appends `.archbuddy/` to your repo's
**`.git/info/exclude`** (a *local* ignore — it never edits your tracked `.gitignore`) so the id-map is
git-ignored before it is written. (Pass an explicit `--out-dir` and you own ignoring it — `collect`
refuses to write the secret to a path that isn't gitignored.)

For a **non-Rails gem or library** (no controllers), the default entrypoint strategy may find no
entrypoints; `collect` warns on stderr and suggests:

```bash
archbuddy collect . --entrypoints all_public
```

`--entrypoints` accepts `default | controllers | all_public | none` (M3).

### 2. Analyze — run the engine on the opaque graph

```bash
# in / via the architecture-auditor engine repo (also defaults to the .archbuddy/ workspace):
architecture-auditor analyze
# → .archbuddy/findings.yml   (opaque; safe to share — keyed by opaque ids only)
```

The engine **never** receives `id-map.yml` — it analyzes the graph without ever seeing real symbols.

### 3. Report — reconnect findings to real symbols, ranked

```bash
archbuddy report
# reads .archbuddy/{findings,id-map,graph}.yml by default.
# add --format yaml|json|dot|html, --top N, or explicit FINDINGS/--id-map/--graph to override.
```

A missing default input fails with a friendly hint (e.g. `no findings at .archbuddy/findings.yml —
run \`architecture-auditor analyze\` first`), never a stack trace.

The report carries **real symbols** → treat it as SECRET/local-only (see below).

### Sample output (Architecture Scores summary + ranked bottlenecks)

```
archbuddy report — clutter ranking

Architecture Scores
------------------------------------------------------------
  Reverse Traceability    58/100  (D)    — can you tell where code is used?
  Forward Discoverability 72/100  (C)    — can you follow where execution goes?

  Reverse Traceability
    top contributors to this dimension (worst-ranked first):
      1. Billing#charge (app/services/billing.rb:8)  [fan_in=42, centrality=0.9000, in_cycle=0]
      2. User#save (app/models/user.rb:12)  [fan_in=2, centrality=0.4000, in_cycle=0]

#1  OrdersController#create  [clutter 9.5000]
    kind: endpoint    app/controllers/orders_controller.rb:5
    metrics:
      path_length  0
      fan_in       0
      fan_out      3
      ...
```

## Reading the report: the two dimensions

The engine scores two **project-level** dimensions (eslint/rubocop-style — the **grade is the
headline**, not any single hotspot):

- **Reverse Traceability** — *"can you tell where code is used?"* Always computable. Driven by
  `fan_in` / `centrality` / `in_cycle` — heavily-depended-on, central, or cyclic nodes are hard to
  trace backward and risky to change.
- **Forward Discoverability** — *"can you follow where execution goes?"* Driven by `path_length` /
  `fan_out`. This is **N/A** when collection found **no entrypoints** (re-collect with
  `--entrypoints all_public`); it renders honestly as `N/A` with that reason, never a fake number.

A **hotspot** is just the worst-*ranked* node for that dimension (a relative top contributor) — on a
clean project the top hotspots may be perfectly benign. Scores are copied **verbatim** from the
engine; archbuddy never recomputes them.

## Interactive HTML report (offline, self-contained)

`--format html` renders the same data as a single, **fully self-contained, fully OFFLINE** HTML
dashboard: the two dimension scores as headline grade cards, an interactive Cytoscape.js call graph,
and the ranked bottleneck table. Cytoscape.js and all CSS/JS are **inlined** into the file — there are
zero external/CDN references, so it opens with no network and no build step.

```bash
archbuddy report --format html > .archbuddy/report.html
open .archbuddy/report.html   # macOS; or just open the file in any browser
```

- The graph nodes come from `graph.yml` (`--graph` defaults to `.archbuddy/graph.yml`); **without a
  graph the scores header + bottleneck table still render** (with a visible notice — no crash).
- Graph controls: toggle labels between **real symbols ↔ opaque ids** (defaults to real, since this is
  the local view), highlight each dimension's hotspots, switch built-in layout (cose/grid/breadthfirst/
  circle), recolor nodes by metric, and click a node (or a table row) to inspect its file:line, kind,
  all 8 metrics, clutter, and finding types in a side panel.
- **Minimum clutter-score filter:** a range slider + synced number input hides graph nodes (and their
  incident edges) below the chosen clutter score, with a live "showing N of M nodes" count. To avoid an
  overwhelming hairball on load it **defaults to a focused view of the worst offenders** (roughly the top
  ~120 nodes by clutter); drag the slider to **0** to reveal the full graph. Re-layout is debounced so
  dragging stays smooth, and highlighting a hotspot or clicking a table row reveals its node even if the
  filter had hidden it.
- **Sortable, paginated bottleneck table:** click any header (clutter score, each metric, symbol, file,
  kind) to sort — repeat-click toggles ascending/descending and the active column shows a ▲/▼ indicator.
  Null/`N/A` metric values always sort last. The table is paginated (rows-per-page selector of 25 / 50 /
  100 / All, default **25**, with Prev/Next and a "showing X–Y of Z" indicator); only the current page is
  rendered. Sorting and pagination are pure presentation over the already-emitted findings — nothing is
  recomputed — and they also work in the no-graph degradation path. A row click still centers and
  highlights the node in the graph regardless of which page it is on.
- The HTML carries **real symbols → SECRET/local-only.** Redirect it to a **gitignored** path (e.g.
  `.archbuddy/report.html` — the `.archbuddy/` workspace is ignored) and **never commit or share it.** The vendored
  `cytoscape.min.js` asset *is* committed (it's a runtime dependency, not a secret — see
  `lib/archbuddy/report/assets/CYTOSCAPE_LICENSE`).

## SECRET: the id-map and de-anonymized reports

`id-map.yml` is the **only** thing that can de-anonymize the opaque graph, and every de-anonymized
report (`terminal` text, `report.yml`, `report.json`, `*.dot`, `report.html`) carries **real
file/line/symbol** names.

- **Never commit** the id-map or any report. The repo `.gitignore` already covers `.archbuddy/`,
  `id-map.yml`, `*.id-map.yml`, `/out/`, `report.yml/json`, `*.dot`, `*.report.html`, `graph.yml`,
  `findings.yml`. (The vendored `cytoscape.min.js` library asset is intentionally NOT ignored — it is
  a runtime dependency, not a secret.)
- **Never share them externally.** They stay **local, on this machine**. `collect` even refuses to
  write the id-map unless its path is gitignored (gitignore-before-secret guard). For the **default
  `.archbuddy/` workspace** inside a git repo, `collect` makes that automatic by appending
  `.archbuddy/` to **`.git/info/exclude`** (a local ignore, never your tracked `.gitignore`) so the
  secret is ignored before it is ever written — you never have to think about it.

## CLI reference

```
archbuddy collect PATH [--out-dir .archbuddy] \
  [--language ruby] [--entrypoints default|controllers|all_public|none] [--entrypoint-pattern REGEX ...]

archbuddy report [FINDINGS_YML] [--id-map .archbuddy/id-map.yml] \
  [--format terminal|yaml|json|dot|html] [--graph .archbuddy/graph.yml] [--top N]
```

`--out-dir` (collect) and `FINDINGS_YML` / `--id-map` / `--graph` (report) all default into the shared
`.archbuddy/` workspace, so the common flow needs no flags. Explicit values override.

## Development

```bash
bundle exec rspec               # full suite
gem build archbuddy.gemspec     # installability check (delete the .gem after)
```
